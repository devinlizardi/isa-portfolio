          my grandma and I would kiss pieces of paper. The lipstick on our lips
          would leave the kiss imprinted. She would fold and pack my kiss into
          her bag and bring it with her to Lima. I would keep her kiss next to
          my bed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These kisses</li>
          <li>were little reminders of love we could hold onto.</li>
        </ul>

          <span className={cs.indent} />
          She and I would also play a game we called <i>señora vecina</i>. In a
          park by my house in Boston, we’d each designate a place we called home
          and visit one another, bringing each other ‘neighborly gifts.’ We’d
          sit together, talking, eating oreos. But we never imagined homes
          together, we were always “neighbors.” It was always either her house,
          or mine.

          Mi abu, missing the times we’d play together, always reminds me of
          this game that we’d play. I only now realize its profoundness, how
          from such an early age, I was interpreting and making sense of the
          distance between us. The many countries and borders between her true
          home and mine.

        <p>Border is the mentality of a child, conceptualizing distance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Border is separation,</li>
          <li>Border is a picture-framed kiss,</li>
          <li>The exhausting navigation of “what if’s”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <span className={cs.indent} />
          In an activity focused on border-thinking, in an exploration of
          in-betweenness, border was conceptualized as a place of feeling, a
          place that everyone experiences at one point in their lives. Everyone
          in the room told their stories of when they were at a border. For some
          reason, I did not think of the distance I felt from my extended
          family. The border I thought of was my emotional state at that time. I
          was in a dark place, caught inside a border that lived within me. I
          thought of a border that lived within me, my inability to comprehend
          my emotional state, a struggle to pull myself through every day.
          Voices bounced from one end of the room to the other, words connecting
          together in shared breath. We were weaving a thread of combined
          experiences, parting from individual feelings. <i>Border es bordar</i>
          . Border is made up of the interlaced stories, hilos únicos que se
          amarran y se sostienen entre ellos. For a moment, we reduced
          omnipresent reality to something tangible. For a moment, we saw a
          coming together, of moments that we had suffered through alone.

          <li>No sé cómo es que me puse a hablar con mi abuela</li>
          <li>Porque no soy de pedir ayuda.</li>
          <li>Yo estaba muy mal. En un espacio mental muy oscuro</li>
          <li>Pero terminamos juntas</li>
          <li>En FaceTime</li>
          <li>Y por ahí</li>
          <li>Ella me hizo respirar</li>
          <li>
            <span className={cs.indent} />
            Inhala
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={cs.indent} />
            Exhala
          </li>
          <li>Nos quedamos ahí mudas.</li>
          <li>Escuchando solo nuestros respiros.</li>
        </ul>

          My grandma says there are no borders between us. I can ask her and
          tell her anything, and we understand each other without needing any
          explanation. “We are similar,” she tells me. “Equally as intense,
          equally as overthinking, equally as prone to pain.” When she answered
          the phone, she saw me and knew, she could feel what I felt, she knew
          how to hold me and secure me from so far away.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cuál es la distancia</li>
          <li>Entre mi respiro</li>
          <li>Y el suyo?</li>
          <li>Entre mi dolor</li>
          <li>Y su compañía?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <span className={cs.indent} />
          In the moments above, borders are places of OUTER complexity and
          confusion but also of intersection and understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className={cs.indent} />I find myself longing for my grandma’s
          creativity, for our ability to transform and transpose the borders we
          face, to give love a concreteness, to be reminded of beauty. I know
          that love, pain, and company have no borders.
