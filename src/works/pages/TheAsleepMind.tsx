        When too overwhelmed, my mind had the capacity to shut my body off, or
        disconnect from my body. It’s as if my body knew better than myself when
        it was time to take a break and it would force my body into (well first
        seizing but then) stillness. And I would wake up disoriented, confused,
        tired, and with very little memory because as time had gone by, I had
        been shut off. But in some strange way, I would also wake up relaxed,
        happy. Post-seizure, I couldn’t do anything, my head would hurt, my body
        would be aching or sore but I wouldn’t know why, so I was forced to do
        nothing. Truly rest. So that mind-body split is what inspired me to take
        this deep dive into documenting my “asleep mind,” which knows more
        things about me than my awake mind. I saw her presence as independent
        from me and I valued her as more intelligent than myself, as my
        protector, as my intuitive guide, and potentially as a creative spirit.
        Obviously a disclosure, my epilepsy is under control thank you to a
        detailed medication regimen. Thank you to my doctors and most of all my
        family and friends who supported me through many years of dedicated
        medication changes.

        Welcome to the inner workings of my brain. I hope they don’t spook you.
        This was a joy to live through, remember, and write.
