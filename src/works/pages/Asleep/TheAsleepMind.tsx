        When too overwhelmed, my mind had the capacity to shut my body off, or
        disconnect from my body. It’s as if my body knew better than myself when
        it was time to take a break and it would force my body into (well first
        seizing but then) stillness. And I would wake up disoriented, confused,
        tired, and with very little memory because as time had gone by, I had
        been shut off. But in some strange way, I would also wake up relaxed,
        happy. Post-seizure, I couldn’t do anything, my head would hurt, my body
        would be aching or sore but I wouldn’t know why, so I was forced to do
        nothing. Truly rest. So that mind-body split is what inspired me to take
        this deep dive into documenting my “asleep mind,” which knows more
        things about me than my awake mind. I saw her presence as independent
        from me and I valued her as more intelligent than myself, as my
        protector, as my intuitive guide, and potentially as a creative spirit.
        Obviously a disclosure, my epilepsy is under control thank you to a
        detailed medication regimen. Thank you to my doctors and most of all my
        family and friends who supported me through many years of dedicated
        medication changes.

        Welcome to the inner workings of my brain. I hope they don’t spook you.
        This was a joy to live through, remember, and write.

        She woke up, teases of her dream still remained. There was heightened
        adrenaline, she wanted more. An adventure cut short by her body knowing
        her natural wake-up time. She followed her morning ritual, washed her
        face and took a shower. As the water fell on her, vivid imagery of the
        dream came again. It was a white horse among others running full speed,
        sometimes she saw them from above, sometimes from the side. The horses’
        manes were majestic as they galloped down a woody path. The trees were
        dark and the sky a hinting blue, unknown if it was sunrise or sunset.
        The speed, the freedom, all factored into the memory. Another image.
        There was a girl laying down in the field seen from above, nothing to
        see but grass. Whether she was the girl, she did not know. These were
        the images recalled in the shower. As she made breakfast and coffee, she
        tried to piece them together. In the morning she had woken up deep in
        the middle of a story that she wanted to continue to be a part of. Now,
        she just had a couple images. How did it go? She was getting frustrated
        at herself for not being able to remember when just a few minutes ago
        she had been living it. As she finished making breakfast, those images
        slipped her mind. She tried to reconstruct them. Tried to relive the
        shower. Tried to remember any small detail about what the dream had been
        about. Nothing came to her. She accepted that her memories had been
        forgotten, as vivid and as real as they had been. And she continued on
        with her day.
