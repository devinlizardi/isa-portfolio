        When too overwhelmed, my mind had the capacity to shut my body off, or
        disconnect from my body. It’s as if my body knew better than myself when
        it was time to take a break and it would force my body into (well first
        seizing but then) stillness. And I would wake up disoriented, confused,
        tired, and with very little memory because as time had gone by, I had
        been shut off. But in some strange way, I would also wake up relaxed,
        happy. Post-seizure, I couldn’t do anything, my head would hurt, my body
        would be aching or sore but I wouldn’t know why, so I was forced to do
        nothing. Truly rest. So that mind-body split is what inspired me to take
        this deep dive into documenting my “asleep mind,” which knows more
        things about me than my awake mind. I saw her presence as independent
        from me and I valued her as more intelligent than myself, as my
        protector, as my intuitive guide, and potentially as a creative spirit.
        Obviously a disclosure, my epilepsy is under control thank you to a
        detailed medication regimen. Thank you to my doctors and most of all my
        family and friends who supported me through many years of dedicated
        medication changes.

        Welcome to the inner workings of my brain. I hope they don’t spook you.
        This was a joy to live through, remember, and write.

        She woke up, teases of her dream still remained. There was heightened
        adrenaline, she wanted more. An adventure cut short by her body knowing
        her natural wake-up time. She followed her morning ritual, washed her
        face and took a shower. As the water fell on her, vivid imagery of the
        dream came again. It was a white horse among others running full speed,
        sometimes she saw them from above, sometimes from the side. The horses’
        manes were majestic as they galloped down a woody path. The trees were
        dark and the sky a hinting blue, unknown if it was sunrise or sunset.
        The speed, the freedom, all factored into the memory. Another image.
        There was a girl laying down in the field seen from above, nothing to
        see but grass. Whether she was the girl, she did not know. These were
        the images recalled in the shower. As she made breakfast and coffee, she
        tried to piece them together. In the morning she had woken up deep in
        the middle of a story that she wanted to continue to be a part of. Now,
        she just had a couple images. How did it go? She was getting frustrated
        at herself for not being able to remember when just a few minutes ago
        she had been living it. As she finished making breakfast, those images
        slipped her mind. She tried to reconstruct them. Tried to relive the
        shower. Tried to remember any small detail about what the dream had been
        about. Nothing came to her. She accepted that her memories had been
        forgotten, as vivid and as real as they had been. And she continued on
        with her day.

        She was in the hospital gift shop. She was getting something for her grandmother. Her aunt had wanted to stop by but hadn’t had the time to do it that day and she was visiting only for a short time. She decided she would go instead. For some reason, she knew she had to be there between 8 and 9:30pm. She walked around the hospital, made it to the gift shop. It was flooded with people and the shop didn’t have anything memorable or particular to the hospital. It looked like one of the shops at JFK airport. Defeated, she decided to head home and as she exited the hospital, her hands went towards a bike. But she hadn’t ridden a bike in years. She Google Maps her way home assuming it’d be a quick ride to a subway stop; except she found out she was in the middle of nowhere surrounded by highways. She panicked. She hadn’t ridden a bike because she had a condition that made her nervous to ride, especially in traffic. She tried taking a road on her left but with the cars zooming by and her having to look at her phone, she knew she would not survive this route. She pulled out her phone and decided to Uber… until she remembered her large bike companion. She headed back to the hospital and asked a young lady at the front desk with short black hair and bangs to help her get back home. She wasn’t hoping for anything from this interaction. It was just a last resort. Surprisingly, the lady showed her to a bike path alongside a highway and told her to stay on it until it ended and diverted to the right. She thanked her and got on her bike. She didn’t need to look at her phone, she could just go. As she started to pedal, her fears melted away, the barrier between her and the cars gave comfort. What a moment ago had been the utmost defeat, now became momentum, she leaned over the handlebars, the cars were passing her on the left and she was speeding. An empty path in front, in the night, just headlights. Motion of feet pedaling at full speed and quick screens of passing things by. I could tell you that it seemed like she was racing the cars, but in actuality, her focus was only forward.

        “Hey…” she mumbled “why did you wake me up? I was biking.” She had slept over at her boyfriend’s place that Friday night.
        “Oh my goodness,” he said while laughing, rolling his eyes, and putting the covers back over her.
        “No, I mean it. I was biking! It felt so nice. I was biking like to infinity,” she said while getting up, excited to share her dream.
        As she followed him into the kitchen, she still felt herself biking. Biking, uninhibited, with no particular destination, just moving. She could still feel herself moving fast and owning her movement. She remembered it was dark, too.
        “Okay so what was this dream?” he asked her.
        “Gah! Wait a second. It’ll come to me.”
        They kept prepping breakfast.
        “I just remember the end, what I was doing when you woke me up. I can’t remember anything else. I don’t know how I got to the bike. Or maybe that was the whole dream, me riding.”
        “Maybe,” he said. Not too interested in dream recountments. Especially this morning where he had been blamed for ruining her pleasurable dream.

      <p>She was so stressed out. She swore she had gotten enough soap bars to last several, several months. But they were down to their last one. When did all the others disappear? How had the time flown by so fast? And more importantly, how had she not realized they were down to one? She loved having extras for essentials, especially for things that can run out as sporadically as soap bars. This had been one of her contributions to her boyfriend’s new place. She wanted to make sure that body soap was covered. So she found herself quite betwixt and even hesitant as she stepped into the shower and was forced to start using the last soap bar, with no extras remaining.
        <br />
        <br />
        She did not forget this dream. It was only until a couple weeks later, when she checked the bathroom storage. And there it was, a packet still basically intact of over 10 bars of soap.

      <p>Something drops into the middle of a vast lake, causing a smooth ripple. You realize the object dropped was a die, a misthrow from an outside dice/card lakehouse game, of which you are a part of. Sitting on the wooden deck, your eyes are now turned toward the games table. Your playmates are stressed over the loss of dice and are looking for new ones. You realize you’re invested in this game and that the next throw is quite important to you. You cannot handle your own impatience and decide to retreat. You slowly back out, without getting up, as if someone were pulling your chair from behind and as if all the doors were opening to your favor. As you’re backing out, you see your playmates continue their search. They do not notice your absence. You pass the interior of the house, the kitchen, the living room, the main entrance, and find yourself sitting outside looking onto the house on a dirt road. From the road, you can see the lake through the trees. You feel something in your pocket and reach in to find a die. You considered going back inside to tell your playmates, but that consideration lasted the length of an inhale. Larger powers had pulled you away from the table. You move the die around in your lap, you’ve now disconnected from the game. Your fingers twidle with it for a bit until you decide to throw it. You throw it straight up into the clear sky. When the die reaches its peak point, the sky ripples as the lake had done so, just moments ago. You catch the object in your lap with both hands and you slowly uncover your right hand to reveal the top number: 3. You don’t know the meaning behind this three. You had forgotten what number you had been hoping for at the games table. You throw again; there are no rules here as you’re playing alone sitting in a chair on a dirt road. The sky ripples again. Catch. Another 3. Hm. One last time I guess, you think to yourself. You throw it higher this time, risking not being able to catch it or having to get out of the chair to save it from dropping. At its peak, the sky undulates. These ripples are the largest and clearest you’d seen so far. The die falls back into your lap. Catch.</p>
      <br />
      <h3 className={cs.sectionSubtitle}>VI.</h3>
      <p>Your hands are clasped together under the pillow. You wake up disoriented. You were waiting for something, but you don’t know what. You move as you get up so you don’t realize your hands were positioned to catch the die, full of anticipation.</p>

      <p>Earlier that day, I had written the prelude to this work. As I was going to sleep, I was remembering the words put on the page, “welcome to the inner workings of my brain.” “I hope they don’t spook you.” “I hope they don’t spook you.” “I hope they don’t spook you.” That line kept repeating itself to me as I lay in bed, eyes closed. Until a bird came flying from above my head, all I could see was its large right wing while I felt it take a hold of the repeated phrase “I hope they don’t spook you.” And then I felt it fly away with it, I saw it do a turn before flying up; it looked like a condor. I felt light, and the phrase was no longer a spiral I was stuck in. Why had this bird visited me? Why had it taken away this phrase? Was it because it didn’t want me to include it in the presentation of the work or was it freeing me of the works presentation? Maybe because I had internalized some scariness / spookiness or better yet, “too much to handle” attached to myself, I had specifically chosen those words. Abrumadora, intensa (to add others). And maybe I could keep the phrase as a joking welcome, as I had originally written it, but I needed some rescue from the real part that I did actually believe to be true. The condor makes up a part of me too.</p>
