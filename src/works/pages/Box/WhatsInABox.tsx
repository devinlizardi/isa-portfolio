        My metal oval tiny case was filled with four translucent orange pills
        and one white emergency one. With that tiny metal case at age 16, I was
        pulled aside by security while entering a club. This was in Lima, Peru.
        I told him I had epilepsy and that those were my meds and he proceeded
        in a very fatherly way to say, “make sure not to drink.” Then he handed
        the case back to me and I went to rejoin my friends who were waiting for
        me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I used that special engraved case that my grandma had given me until
        some more pills were added to the regimen. And then another few. So much
        so that the daily metal case was switched out for a transparent pink box
        with two dividers creating four sections.
        <br />
        <br />
        This pink box was inspected in NYC in 2023 while entering a club. The
        security guard was so doubtful I had to show her a card with my
        diagnosis and my doctor’s name. She acted disgustingly towards me for
        carrying extra pills. “Are you going to be here until tomorrow? … No. I
        didn’t think so.” I wouldn’t be going home directly after, if she really
        wanted to know. In the process of yammering, she dropped all my pills on
        the floor and blamed me for it. Pills I had to take that night and then
        the next morning.
        <br />
        <br />
        When those pink sections overflowed with pills, more tests, more
        prescriptions, my mother got me 2 weekly pill cases with spaces for AM
        and PM. Monday is orange, Tuesday is yellow, Wednesday is lime green,
        Thursday is light blue, Friday is blue, Saturday is purple, Sunday is
        red. And so it repeats. Orange, yellow, lime green, light blue, blue,
        purple, red.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have been made to feel like I am doing something wrong. I have been
        stressed while getting my bags checked anywhere, while passing through
        security at the airport, while packing, not knowing how much to bring or
        what to put where because suspicion may arise.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am warmed remembering now that knowledgeable and caring interaction in
        Peru.
